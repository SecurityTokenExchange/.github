# .SecurityToken.Exchage
OpenSource, Decentralized Security Token Exchange

We have build our DEX on four core pilars:

## Compliancy
your assets, your wallet. Our exchange does not requre you to send any assets to us. You do not give away your control, voting power, dividends etc. when you trade your securities on STEX, or one of the affiliated trading venues.

## Interoperability
We believe that building on top of the polymesh blockchain is the best way for a security token exchange to serve the market. But building on top of a institutional security token blockchain comes with a huge network effect, and mutliple separate orderbooks that all operate in a similar way.
Our orderbook is designed in a way that allows interoperability between multiple trading venues, where a trader on DAPP-1 can trade trade in a orderbook created and managed by DAPP-2, while each DAPP has their own ground rules, and logic behind the trading venue.

## Security
Our smart contracts are opensoruce, to imrpove security and to transparancy in the ecosystem.

## Accessability
no mether where on the world you are, you will always have access to the trading interface, your assets, and your opertunities.
